# Getting Started with Linux
---

Linux is an operating system ecosystem widely used on servers, cloud infrastructure, data centers, embedded systems, and increasingly on personal computers.  
It is known for stability, security, flexibility, and its open-source nature.

At its core, **Linux itself is not a complete operating system**.  
Linux is the **kernel** used by a family of open-source, Unix-like operating systems, commonly referred to as **GNU/Linux**.

## 💻 What Is an Operating System?
An operating system (OS) is system software that:

- Manages computer hardware (CPU, memory, storage, networking)
- Provides essential services for applications
- Acts as the bridge between hardware and user-level programs

---

## 🦄 What Is Unix?
Unix is a powerful, multi-user operating system originally developed in the 1970s.  
Many modern operating systems—including Linux and macOS—are inspired by Unix concepts such as:

- Multi-user design
- Permissions and security models
- Command-line tools and scripting philosophy

---

## 🤖 What Is a Kernel?
The kernel is the **core component** of an operating system.  
Its responsibilities include:

- CPU scheduling
- Memory management
- Device and hardware communication
- Networking and process control
```
Hardware → Kernel → User Applications
```
----------------------

Linux is **only** the kernel, not the entire operating system.

---

## 🟢 What Is GNU in GNU/Linux?
**GNU** stands for **“GNU’s Not Unix”**.

- Initiated in **1983** by Richard Stallman
- Goal: create a completely free and open-source Unix-like operating system

GNU provides essential tools such as:
- Compilers (gcc)
- Shells (bash)
- Core utilities (ls, cp, grep, etc.)

Linux + GNU tools together form what we commonly call **GNU/Linux**.

---

## 📜 Software Licensing (GPL)
Most GNU software—and the Linux kernel itself—is released under the **GPL (General Public License)**.

The GPL promotes:
- Freedom to use software
- Freedom to study and modify source code
- Freedom to distribute copies and improvements

---

## 🐧 Linux Distributions
A **Linux distribution (distro)** is a complete operating system built on top of the Linux kernel.

Each distribution includes:
- The Linux kernel
- GNU tools
- A package manager
- Additional software tailored to specific needs

Examples of user-focused goals:
- Servers (Ubuntu Server, Rocky Linux)
- Desktop users (Ubuntu, Linux Mint)
- Developers and power users (Arch, Fedora)
- Security and penetration testing (Kali Linux)

Different distros exist because different users have different needs.

## 🧠 What to Expect When Learning Linux
Learning Linux is less about memorizing commands and more about understanding how systems work:

- Files and permissions
- Processes and services
- Networking basics
- Shell usage and scripting

Once you grasp these ideas, Linux stops being “hard” and starts being *predictable*.
